<p>• Other computer experience</p>
    <p>I have used computers since I was in high school many years ago. I had a basic programming class there but honestly don&#39;t remember any of it. I have used excel, word, etc in business applications for years.</p>
<p>• Business Education and Experience</p>
<p> I am almost done with my degree program here at UMSL. I have taken a plethora of business classes as we all have. Most of them a waste fo time and money in my opinion. I have been in management for several businesses over my life time. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>











&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•  GPA 3.00<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	UMSL GPA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;					Business GPA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		MIS GPA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


&nbsp;3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<dl>On a scale from 1-10, with “1" as low and “10" as high, provide the following:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<dd>self-rating of your ability to coordinate team projects (any evidence?)<dd>&nbsp;<p>9. I have been in business and a classroom teacher so coordinating projects is second nature for these vocations. <p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	


    <p>
        self-rating of your creativity (any evidence?)</p>
    <li></li>
    <li>I would rate my creativity as middle of the road. 5 My creativity is often tied to my knowledge of the domain. If, if I dont have extensive knowledge then i tend to not be the most creative. However, with knowledge and passion my creativity skyrockets.<br /></li>
    <dl>
        <dd>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>








&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
        <dd>&nbsp;self-rating of your communication skills (any evidence?)<li>
        <br />
        I have very good communications skills. 8-9 Would be the range I would put myself. My education experience both as a student and as an educator honed my abilities in this area. My business background did as well. As a former manager I had the every day tesk of making sure my employees understood what they needed to do.</li>
        <dd>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<dd>•  self-rating of your analytical skills (any evidence?)
<p>7 My ability to analyse has always been good. I have the ability to take a task and break it into it&#39;s components and then make recomendations for the parts and the whole project. <p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<dd>•  experience relevant to the project area
<p>Honestly I would say 0. I have never worked on projects similiar to the one at hand.<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		<dd>•  knowledge of /experience with web pages
<p>0 again. Unless you take in to count browsing websites, then like most people in the interent age, I have extensive experience.<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		<dd>•  knowledge of /experience with not-for-profit organizations
<p>6&nbsp; I have no experience working for non profits however i am familiar with a few and have donated money to some. <p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		<dd>•  knowledge of /experience with “helping” organizations
<p>none<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<dd>• greatest strength you bring to the team
<p>My organizational skills and attention to details. <p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<dd>• greatest weakness you bring to the team
<p>My inexperience with system analysis and programming. <p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<dd>•  days and times when you cannot meet with the team (including course and work schedules)
<p>Other than classes I am pretty flexible with my time. Wednesday and Thursday evenings I have class till 940. <p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>










&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<dd>•  city (or geographical area) in which you live.
<p>O&#39;Fallon, Mo<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<dd>•  other information about you that would help explain your readiness for the project and/or special skills that would help your team complete the project
<p>My ability to focus my energy on the task at hand and to ensure accurate and excellence in completion of the project.<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>
